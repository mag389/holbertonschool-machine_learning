BLEU, ROUGE, and Perplexity.

BLEU measure a model's precision, whereas ROUGE measures a model's precision and also recall

perplexity is a measure of branching factor of a prediction

BLEU was designed for machine translation. However BLEU has several shortcomings.
It cannot judge grammatical accuracy, cannot judge meaning, does not work with languages
that lack words boundaries, and a higher score is nor necessarily a better translation
