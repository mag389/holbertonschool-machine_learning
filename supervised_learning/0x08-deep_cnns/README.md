# Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

this folder cover some deeper convolutional neural network concepts.

These topics include the use and implementation of inception modules
and inception networks.

# additional diagrams:
for this project i made duplicate main file each with a model plotting included
That is what produced the various model png image files
