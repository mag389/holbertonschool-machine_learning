# Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

this folder cover some deeper convolutional neural network concepts.

These topics include the use and implementation of inception modules
and inception networks.

one of the best explanatoins of resnet and identity/projection blocks I found

# additional diagrams:
for this project i made duplicate main file each with a model plotting included
That is what produced the various model png image files
to get this to run corrcetly i needed to install graphviz with
'sudo apt-get install graphviz'
