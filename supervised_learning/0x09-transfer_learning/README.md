# Transfer learning
This project deals with transfer learning. Here i will be using transfer learning to
train a neural network on the cifar-10 dataset.

* [A Comprehensive Hands-on Guide to Transfer Learning with Real-World Applications in Deep Learning](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
* [deeplearning.ai Transfer learnin video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQM13HkEfBk&index=20&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Gl29AoE31iwdVwSG-KnDzF)

The purpose of this project is to wite a python script that trains a convolutional neural network to classify CIFAR 10

to do so I will make use of a keras application and use transfer learning to take advantage of previiously trained weights.

The script makes a model in the current working directory (the model is cifar10.h5)
this model can then be imported and used for new data
