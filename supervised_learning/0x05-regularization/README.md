# Regularization

Overfitting is a very common problem in machine learning.

Overfitting happens when you gie too much importance to noise in training data.
It manifests in such cases when the training data error is very low, but the real use case  error remains higher. (low bias high variance)

to solve this problem we can employ regularization, which manipulates the
learning algorithm to hepl the model generalize better.

chiefly this folder will demonstrate/use L1 and L2 regularization.
