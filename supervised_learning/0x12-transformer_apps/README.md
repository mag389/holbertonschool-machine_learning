# Tranformer Applications

note: applications here use TF version 2.4.1 (or later) and may not work
with earlier versions.


This folder covers uses of rtansformers in different contexts.
We can get data to use for many contexts from the tonsorflow-datasets package

'pip install --user tensorflow-datasets'

since this project has no automated checking i used comparison result files
