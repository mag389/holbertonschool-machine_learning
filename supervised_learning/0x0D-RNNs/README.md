# recurrent neural networks

The use an implementation of recurrent neural networks
first tasks deal with standard RNN's then move on to GRU cells followed by bidirectional RNN's

using RNN's: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/text_classification_rnn


are lstm's on the way out in favor of transformers?

can they even replace cnn's? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrdevFK_am4
