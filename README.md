I am a Cornell Grad and Current Holberton student studying Machine Learning. Particularly interested in predictive analytics and data science.

There are three main folders for machine learning project: Reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning.
Additionally there are two supplementary folders for necessary topics: math, which covers
needed math topics such as linear algebra, and pipeline, which covers the ML pipeline such as 
collection and use of data.

## Extra Sources:
These sources cover big topics and/or dependencies that are used in all sub folders
